# e-Taberna
E-Taberna is a modern e-commerce web application built using a **microservices** architecture. 
The name "Taberna" is derived from the Latin word for "tavern" or "shop", historically referring to a place where goods were bought and sold. Inspired by this, e-Taberna is designed as a digital marketplace that facilitates seamless transactions and shopping experiences.



## System Architecture   
The project follows a microservices-based design, where each service is responsible for a specific domain within the e-commerce platform.

## Tech Stack
- **.NET Core 9** for backend services  
- **YARP** for API Gateway  
- **RabbitMQ** for message-based communication  
- **gRPC** for inter-service communication  
- **SQL Server** for data persistence  



## Project Structure  

### üèó Building Blocks  

Contains shared modules such as **Messaging**, which provides communication mechanisms between microservices.

### üö™ API Gateway  

Contains **YARP Gateway**, which acts as the **API gateway** for routing requests between services.


### üõ† Services  

Independent microservices handling different domains of the application:

#### üîê Auth Service  
- Handles **user authentication and authorization**.  
- Uses **JWT** and **.NET Identity** for security.  

#### üì¶ Order Service  
- Manages **orders, order processing, and status updates**.  
- Handles **payments via Stripe**.  
- **Publishes RabbitMQ events** on **successful payment**.  

#### üéüÔ∏è Coupon Service  
- Manages **discounts and promotional codes**.  
- Integrates with **Stripe** for **coupon creation**.  
- Exposes a **gRPC service** for other microservices to validate and apply coupons.  

#### üõí ShoppingCart Service  
- Handles **cart management** (adding, updating, and removing items).  
- Acts as a **gRPC client** for the **Coupon Service** to validate and apply discounts.  
- **Consumes RabbitMQ events** from **Order Service** to delete the cart on **successful payment**.  

#### üè∑Ô∏è ProductCatalog Service  
- Manages **product listings, categories, and inventory**.  
- **Consumes RabbitMQ events** from **Order Service** to update inventory on **successful payment**.
